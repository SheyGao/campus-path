Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

Inside LabeledGraph, I created Nodes class and Edges class because the basic elements of graph are built in this way.
Also, I provided methods so that they make up the basic functions of a directed labeled graph. I feel these are sufficient
to a graph because the methods provided allow us to build, access, and modify the elements of a map.
These are the basic methods that make the operation work. I created Nodes class and Edges class because the LabeledGraph
class itself becomes cleaner and simpler. It can focus on managing the overall structure of the graph,
connecting nodes through edges, and performing graph-related operations.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

The testing strategy is to test every behavior that script test didn't test for in JUnit test, so that
combing these two test it should cover most cases. They are different in usage, as we use JUnit tests
for ensuring the correctness of individual code units, and use script tests for validating the system as a whole.
The combination of unit tests and script tests contributes to a more robust application. They differ
because of their focus and purpose of testing.
