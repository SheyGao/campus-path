# Test if two nodes, four edge can be added to the graph
# (one edge points to itself, the other edge points to the other node)

# Create a Graph
created graph graph2

# Add a node to the graph
added node a to graph2
added node b to graph2

# Add a edge to the graph
added edge e4 from a to a in graph2
added edge e5 from a to b in graph2
added edge e6 from b to b in graph2
added edge e7 from b to a in graph2

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a, the outgoing edges from b
graph2 contains: a b
the children of a in graph2 are: a(e4) b(e5)
the children of b in graph2 are: b(e6) a(e7)
