# Test if two nodes, two edge can be added to the graph (two edges: point to each other)

# Create a Graph
created graph graph2

# Add a node to the graph
added node a to graph2
added node b to graph2

# Add a edge to the graph
added edge e2 from a to b in graph2
added edge e3 from b to a in graph2

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a, the outgoing edges from b
graph2 contains: a b
the children of a in graph2 are: b(e2)
the children of b in graph2 are: a(e3)
