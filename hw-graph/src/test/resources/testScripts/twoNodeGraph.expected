# Test if two nodes can be added

# Create a Graph
created graph graph2

# Add a node to the graph
added node a to graph2
added node b to graph2

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, the outgoing edges from b
graph2 contains: a b
the children of a in graph2 are:
the children of b in graph2 are:
