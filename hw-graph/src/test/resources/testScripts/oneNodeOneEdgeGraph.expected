# Test if a node, a edge can be added to the graph

# Create a Graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to the graph
added node n1 to graph1

# Add a edge to the graph
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
