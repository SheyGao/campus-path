Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

Besides making the existing implementation generic, I also changes the parameter of the Edges object,
Originally, I had parent, child, label for making up an edge, and now I'm having only child and label for making up
an edge. By using only the child node and label in the edge, we can rely on the existing graph structure
to manage the relationship between parent and child nodes. Additionally, I added hashCode() method and equals() method
to Node and Edges classes. As the default equals() is for objects, but we have to override the method to
accommodate the generics type. In my test driver code, I also changed the data type of my test nodes from String to
Nodes<String>. Also, I declared the graph to be HashMap<String, LabeledGraph<String, String>> graphs =
new HashMap<String, LabeledGraph<String, String>>() in the test code. By doing these in my test files,
it manages to accommodate the generics and makes the test cases work.
