## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test because n=0 is included in the if statement,
and it returns 0 is negative when n=0 whereas 0 is non-negative. I excluded n=0 in the if statement and changed
n<=0 to n<0.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because when n=0 it should return 1, however, the original code
threw exception. To fix this, make n=0 go into the else if statement so that it returned 1.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase test because the test expected getFibTerm(2) to be <2> but it returned <1>.
n=2 is included in the else if statement, where when n=2 it automatically returns 1. To fix this, I excluded
n=2 in the else if statement so n=2 goes to the else statement, and it returns the sum of first element and second
element in the series. In this case, it returns the correct result <2>.

## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

The value of x is 4, value of y is 4, and value of sum is 0. x is not equal to the first integer
because x is not set to be equal to the exact inputted value in the main method.
Originally, when the inputted value is 5, it processes as int x = 2 * 2 = 4.
So we changed int x = 2 * (console.nextInt() / 2) to int x = console.nextInt() to make sure
that x is the exact first value we inputted.

2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

In the "Variables" panel, x=3, y=4. The current method and line number is computeSum:45, Adder (setup).
return x - y; is also highlighted in Adder.java.

3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

After the first step over, there's x=3, y=4, args = {String[0]@765}[], console = {Scanner@766}
After the second step over, there is a new variable and its value: sum = -1.
